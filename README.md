# Heart-Murmur-Identification-Screening
The report will be able to identify and develop a predictive model which can determine Children with Congenital heart defects and Adults with Heart valve defects using machine learning algorithm?‚Äù
The answers for these questions will help the audience to take it further developing a business model which can help to creating a portable device which can predict and identify Heart murmur.
A Classification report with the confusion matrix, learning curve, box-plots are the metrics which will be used to evaluate the algorithm to find out accurate responding model. The model will look for output variable classified as 0-Normal patients, 1- Congenital heart defect-Babies, 2- Heart Valve Defect-Adults.
Heart valve defects can be seen at the time of birth with new born babies and also it is seen in adults as well. With this project, the algorithm will find out a prediction model to diagnose heart defects in other patients across the age group
